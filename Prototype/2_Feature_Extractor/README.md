### Extracting feature vectors from Keras Applications or Tensorflow Hub

We will now extract the feature vectors from an existing network to use them later for clustering our scraped data. 

* Keras: [notebook](https://github.com/DominikBoenisch/Training-the-Archive/blob/master/Prototype/2_Feature_Extractor/Feature_Extractor_Keras_Applications.ipynb)
* Tensorflow Hub: [notebook](https://github.com/DominikBoenisch/Training-the-Archive/blob/master/Prototype/2_Feature_Extractor/Feature_Extractor_Tensorflow_hub.ipynb)

The notebooks were made possible with the help of Dr. rer. nat. Jan SÃ¶lter.

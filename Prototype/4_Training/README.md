### Training of a network with our annotations, which artworks are related and which are not

We start training a network whose features we have downloaded in advance and which we want to implement. We use our annotated data from the training data generator. As a result we get a *relearned* network which we can evaluate in a second step.

The notebooks were made possible with the help of [Dr. rer. nat. Jan Sölter](https://de.linkedin.com/in/jansoelter) and Dr. rer. nat. Thomas Rost.
